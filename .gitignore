# This file is generated by Unity. Ignore all files except the ones listed.
# Lines starting with "!" are included files.
#
# If you need to check in files that are explicitly ignored, such as built
# libraries, use a negating pattern like:
#
#    !/Assets/Plugins/MyNativeLibrary.dll
#
# and make sure that the parent directories are NOT ignored.
#
# Note: UnityGit requires this file to be present in the project root,
# otherwise it will not work.
