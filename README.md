## Project Status

* **Completion Date:** June 2024
* **Upload Date:** October 2025

## Project Summary: Multiplayer XR Combat Game

This project is a fully-developed **Multiplayer Mixed Reality (MR) game** built for an XR (Extended Reality) platform, during time in university.
Development prioritized core functionality over architectural optimization, due to the compressed timeline.

### Key Highlights & Developer Contribution

* Solo End-to-End Delivery: The entire project, from initial concept to final documentation, was completed independently.
* Intense Development Cycle: Delivered a complete, functional game in a **highly constrained one-month (1-month) timeframe**.
* Full-Stack Game Development: Personally handled all core development disciplines:
* Art/Modeling
* Rendering/Shading implementation
* Programming/Gameplay Logic
* Testing & Quality Assurance
* Technical Documentation

### Critical Challenges Overcome:

* Successfully integrated Multiplayer Functionality within the XR environment, a technically complex task.
* Achieved a Stylized Rendering Aesthetic to enhance visual appeal and thematic consistency.


## Game Description

This is a cooperative **Multiplayer Mixed Reality (MR) game** designed for virtual and physical collaboration.

Players step into an immersive experience within their own physical space, where they must work together to survive against waves of enemies.

## Key Features

* **Multiplayer Co-op:** Designed for simultaneous play, requiring teamwork to succeed.
* **Device Compatibility:** Fully compatible with **Meta Quest 3** and **Meta Quest Pro**.
* **Boundary System:** Players can define their activity zone within the room. Enemies, weapons, and essential items will automatically spawn within this defined boundary.
* **Dynamic Spawning:** Automatic spawning of enemies, weapons, and items keeps the gameplay challenging and unpredictable.
* **Styleized Shader:** Implemented custom "Phisical based cartoon shader", with manga shadow effect stuffs.
